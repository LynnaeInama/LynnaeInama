About Me :
I am a back end software developer just starting out.  I have spent 27 years as an Accountant / Accounting Analyst.  I decided a career change was in order, or even the possibility of meshing the Accounting Analyst with the Developer role to help organizations out. I love to code and have enjoyed the learning process.  Every day I am excited to discover what I am going to learn.  Currently we are learning to code Java and have covered Conditionals and Loops.
